# Example YAML configuration for go3mf
# This file demonstrates how to define multiple objects with multiple parts

# Output file path (relative to this config file or absolute)
output: combined_from_yaml.3mf

# Define objects - each object groups related parts
objects:
  # First object - a simple single-part object
  - name: Base
    parts:
      - name: platform
        file: a.scad
        filament: 1  # Use AMS slot 1 (optional, 0 or omit for auto-assign)

  # Second object - a multi-part object
  - name: Assembly
    parts:
      - name: main_body
        file: b.scad
        filament: 2  # Use AMS slot 2
      
      - name: cover
        file: a.scad
        filament: 3  # Use AMS slot 3

# Notes:
# - File paths can be relative to this YAML file or absolute
# - Filament values: 0 or omitted = auto-assign, 1-4 = AMS slots
# - Each part will be rendered separately and combined into one 3MF file
# - Parts within an object will be named as "object_name/part_name" in the output
