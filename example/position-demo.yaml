# Example demonstrating position normalization and relative positioning features
# This shows how to control object placement on the build plate

packing_distance: 15.0

objects:
  # Object 1: Default behavior - normalized to ground level (z=0)
  # All objects are placed on the ground by default
  - name: GroundObject
    parts:
      - name: part
        file: a.scad
        filament: 1
        # No position specified - sits on ground at (0,0,0) relative to object

  # Object 2: Multi-part object with relative positioning
  # Parts maintain their relative positions while the whole group is normalized to ground
  - name: Assembly
    parts:
      - name: base
        file: a.scad
        filament: 2
        # Base at origin

      - name: top
        file: b.scad
        filament: 3
        # Position top part 10mm above base (z direction)
        position_z: 10

      - name: side
        file: a.scad
        filament: 4
        # Position side part offset in x direction
        position_x: 15
        position_z: 5

  # Object 3: Disable normalization - keep original z-position from model
  # Use this when you want precise z-positioning or the model is already positioned correctly
  - name: NoNormalization
    normalize_position: false  # Disable ground-level normalization
    parts:
      - name: floating
        file: a.scad
        # This will keep its original z-position from the 3D model
        # Useful when the SCAD file has specific z-positioning built in

  # Object 4: Complex positioning with rotation
  - name: ComplexPart
    parts:
      - name: main
        file: b.scad
        rotation_z: 45  # Rotate 45 degrees around Z axis
        position_x: 5   # Offset 5mm in X direction
        position_y: 5   # Offset 5mm in Y direction

# Key features:
# 1. normalize_position (default: true)
#    - true: Objects are placed at ground level (z=0)
#    - false: Objects keep their original z-position from the model
#
# 2. position_x, position_y, position_z (default: 0)
#    - Relative offsets within an object
#    - When multiple parts share an object, they maintain relative positions
#    - Positions are in millimeters
#
# 3. Combined with rotation:
#    - Rotation is applied first, then position offset
#    - All at the object's origin before packing on the build plate
